Make sure the following files are installed before running the program:
-Python
-openCV
-Tesseract
-VS Code

In "Image_Processing2.py" make sure the "text = ir.extract_text" under "ir = ImageReader(OS)" (Lines 25 and 26) is set to your directory. It's hardcoded to specific computer so it must be changed to yours.
For example, "C:\\Users\\twelton\\Desktop\\SE_PRJ_AI_Image\\SE1_Project_1-main\\SE1_Project_1-main\\Project_Code\\Test_Image0.png" Only the user name and Desktop would need to be changed to YOUR user name and to
wherever your file is located.

I hope this helps.
